# Builder Structures

Place NBT structure files in this directory:
- builder_level_1.nbt - Level 1 builder station structure
- builder_level_2.nbt - Level 2 builder station structure (optional)
- builder_level_3.nbt - Level 3 builder station structure (optional)

## Creating Structure Files

1. Build your structure in-game using `/setblock` or creative mode
2. Use `/save builder_level_1` to save the structure
3. Find the .nbt file in `.minecraft/saves/[world]/generated/[namespace]/structures/`
4. Copy the .nbt file here

Structure files are binary NBT format - you cannot edit them as text.
